## Description
This script processes a series of test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer X and a list of X integers. It sums the fourth power of all negative integers in the list and returns -1 if the number of integers doesn't match X.

## Constraints Handled
- No global variables
- No loops or comprehensions
- Standard libraries only
- Final output printed after all input is read

## How to Run
Run the script with standard input redirected from a file:


python3 main.py < input.txt
